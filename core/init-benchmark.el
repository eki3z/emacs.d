(cl-defmacro bench-multi (&key (times 1) forms ensure-equal raw)
  "Return Org table as a list with benchmark results for FORMS.
Runs FORMS with `benchmark-run-compiled' for TIMES iterations.

When ENSURE-EQUAL is non-nil, the results of FORMS are compared,
and an error is raised if they aren't `equal'.  If the results are
sequences, the difference between them is shown with
`seq-difference'.

When RAW is non-nil, the raw results from
`benchmark-run-compiled' are returned instead of an Org table
list.

If the first element of a form is a string, it's used as the
form's description in the bench-multi-results; otherwise, forms
are numbered from 0.

Before each form is run, `garbage-collect' is called."
  ;; MAYBE: Since `bench-multi-lexical' byte-compiles the file, I'm not sure if
  ;; `benchmark-run-compiled' is necessary over `benchmark-run', or if it matters.
